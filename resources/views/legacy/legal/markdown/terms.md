## Part One: Terms Governing Use of the Site and Services

### Medical Information

This website may contain general information relating to various medical conditions and their treatment. Such information is provided for *informational purposes only.* The content of this website is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The content relating to medical conditions and their treatment is not meant to be a substitute for advice provided by a doctor or other qualified healthcare professionals. You should not disregard or delay seeking medical advice based on anything that appears in this website. IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, YOU SHOULD DIAL "911" IMMEDIATELY. You should not use the information contained herein for diagnosing a health problem or disease. YOU SHOULD NOT CONSTRUE THIS CONTENT AS ANY WARRANTY OR RECOMMENDATION OF TREATMENT. Use of the Website does not create a physician/patient or provider/patient relationship with Harvey. Harvey is not recommending or endorsing any specific test, diet regimen or other information.

**Jurisdiction.** Harvey practitioners are licensed in their home states only, and we make no claim in regards to licensing beyond their home jurisdiction.  The following states license Naturopathic Doctors:  AL, AR, CA, CT, HI, ID, KS, MA, MN, MT, NH, ND, OR, UT, VT, WA along with the District of Columbia.  We do not provide services in AL, FL, NY, SC, TN or outside the U.S.  In all other States not referenced here, the services offered by Provider are alternative or complementary to healing arts services licensed by the State.  These services include: general dietary and lifestyle advice and health coaching. Provider has training in these services and is licensed in Provider’s home state, but is operating in the capacity of a general health coach in states in which Provider is not licensed.  Health coaching involves making general lifestyle suggestion and attuning the client to health goals and habits.

**Healthcare Services.** All of the treating Providers who deliver Services through Harvey are independent professionals solely responsible for the services each provides to you. Harvey does not practice medicine or any other licensed profession, and does not interfere with the practice of medicine or any other licensed profession by Providers, each of whom is responsible for his or her services and compliance with the requirements applicable to his or her profession and license. Neither Harvey nor any third parties who promote the services or provide you with a link to the service shall be liable for any professional advice you obtain.

### Informed Consent.

**A.** Telehealth is the delivery of health care services using interactive audio and video technology, where the patient and the health care professional are not in the same physical location. During your telehealth consultation, details of your health history and personal health information may be discussed with you through the use of interactive video, audio and other telecommunications technology, and your Provider may perform a physical examination through these technologies.

**B.** The telehealth services you receive are not intended to replace a primary care physician relationship or be your permanent medical home. You may form an ongoing treatment relationship with some Providers. However, your initial visit with a Provider will begin as a consultation (e.g. to determine the most appropriate treatment setting for you to receive care) and will not necessarily give rise to an ongoing treatment relationship. You should seek emergency help or follow-up care when recommended by a Provider or when otherwise needed, and continue to consult with your primary care physician and other healthcare professionals as recommended. Among the benefits of our Services are improved access to healthcare professionals and convenience. However, as with any health service, there are potential risks associated with the use of telehealth. These risks include, but may not be limited to:

-   In rare cases, information transmitted may not be sufficient (e.g. poor resolution of images) to allow for appropriate health care decision making by the Provider;

-   Delays in evaluation or treatment could occur due to failures of the electronic equipment. If this happens, you may be contacted by phone or other means of communication.

-   In rare cases, a lack of access to all of your health records may result in adverse interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors;

-   Although the electronic systems we use will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the privacy and security of health information, in rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal health information

**C.** By accepting these Terms of Use, you acknowledge that you
understand and agree with the following:

-   You understand that you may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telehealth in your care, but that no results can be guaranteed or assured.

-   You understand that the laws that protect the privacy and security of health information apply to telehealth, and have received our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) which describes these protections in more detail.

-   Harvey may choose not to accept any health insurance coverage for services. In the event we do accept health insurance, If your health insurance coverage does not include or is not sufficient to satisfy the Services charges in full, you may be fully or partially responsible for payment.

-   Your Provider may determine that the Services are not appropriate for some or all of your treatment needs, and accordingly may elect not to provide telehealth services to you through the Site.

BY VISITING OUR SITE AND SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD HARMLESS HARVEY, AND ANY AFFILIATED HARVEY ENTITY, ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, AND REPRESENTATIVES (COLLECTIVELY "HARVEY PARTIES") FROM AND AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, ACTIONS, DEMANDS, LIABILITIES, JUDGMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, COSTS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, TAX ASSESSMENTS, PENALTIES, INTEREST AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES) ARISING OUT OF ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR ANY OTHER CLAIM YOU MAY INCUR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OUR SITE AND SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CLAIMS FOR DEFAMATION, VIOLATION OF PUBLICITY OR PRIVACY, COPYRIGHT OR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT RESULTING FROM YOUR SUBMISSIONS OF ANY CONTENT, TAGGED CONTENT OR OTHER MATERIALS, ANY ECONOMIC HARM, LOST PROFITS, DAMAGES TO BUSINESS, DATA OR COMPUTER SYSTEMS, OR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM RELIANCE ON ANY CONTENT OR RESULTING FROM ANY INTERRUPTIONS, WORK STOPPAGES, COMPUTER FAILURES, DELETION OF FILES, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, INACCURACIES, DEFECTS, VIRUSES, DELAYS OR MISTAKES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY ADVISED HARVEY OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH CLAIM.

### Disputes

If a dispute of any kind arises, we want to understand and address your concerns quickly and to your satisfaction. Please contact [support@goharvey.com](mailto:support@goharvey.com) with any dispute. If we cannot resolve your concerns, we agree to an informal and inexpensive dispute resolution process requiring individual arbitration. "Disputes" between you and Harvey, including its processors, suppliers or licensors or their respective affiliates, agents, directors or employees, are defined for the purposes of these Terms and Conditions to include any claim, controversy, or dispute (whether involving contract, tort, equitable, statutory, or any other legal theory) between you and Harvey including, but not limited to, any claims relating in any way to these Terms and Conditions (including its breach, termination, or interpretation), any other aspect of our relationship, Harvey advertising, and any use of Harvey services.

### Binding Individual Arbitration

You and Harvey agree to arbitrate all Disputes. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE ONLY BE ON A INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST HARVEY. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced (but in no case shall there be a class arbitration). All Disputes shall be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by ADR Services, Inc. according to this provision and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum. Consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use) may elect to pursue their claims in their local small-claims court rather than through arbitration. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies. If you are a consumer bringing a claim relating to personal, household, or family use, any arbitration hearing will occur within the county or parish where you reside. Otherwise, any arbitration hearing will occur in Los Angeles County, California, or another mutually agreeable location, or a location ordered by the arbitrator. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to attorney's fees, you may recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, Harvey will not seek to have you pay its attorney's fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Harvey also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors, and assigns.
