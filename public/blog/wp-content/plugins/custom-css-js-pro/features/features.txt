2. The options are working (external/internal, header/footer, frontend/admin)
3. Less and SASS pre-processors 
4. Minify the code
5. Preview the changes by adding an URL
    - save the preview URL for future use
6. Apply only on these URLs
    - make a unit test for this and try different combinations
7. Code revisions
    - if there is a change in the options, it doesn't save a new revision
    - the pre-processor and minify options aren't shown/saved in the revision
    - on restore, test if the options also are restored
8. Permissions control
    - see how Visual Composer controls who is allowed to use the plugin per roles or usernames
