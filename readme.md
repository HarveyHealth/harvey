# Magic Bean Project
This is intended to be a vanilla project that includes everything you need to quickly get moving. Basically, it has the bones any website needs. User accounts, queues, ready-to-customize templates.

It should _not_ have anything that ties it to a specific project. The idea is to fork this for any real project and have something that gets you going much faster.
